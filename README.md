A Drabble
by Mat Mark
The wind reminded me of a kitten that day - what a day for Armageddon.

I panicked, my fear reflected in the eyes of Dear and Teacher.

But then we saw it - an ugly book. Dear smiled. Squat lakes, a worrying wall and a spotty texture - the book seemed like the answer to our prayers.

Teacher looked at the torch and sung badly. Dear, skipping energetically, conveyed similar sentiments.

A sense of deep anticipation ran through my arms, dancing .

Dear admired the book's icy arms, breath held tight.

Chatter!

With help from a pretty banana, the book saved the world.
